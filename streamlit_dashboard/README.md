The wireframe outlines the initial design of the dashboard. It includes a login page for user authentication and account creation, and a main page where users can view product price trends, track new products, unsubscribe from tracking, and filter data by time ranges. This layout provides an intuitive and functional interface for managing and visualizing product price tracking.
